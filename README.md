# Coffee Orders Data Analysis – Excel Pivot Charts Project


## Project Overview

This project analyses customer coffee order trends using Microsoft Excel to help a coffee business understand purchasing behaviour, optimise product offerings, and improve operational decisions. The dataset includes order details such as coffee types, roast profiles, sizes, sales figures, and customer demographics.

Using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts, I summarised the data to uncover key trends in customer preferences, sales performance by region, and seasonal ordering patterns.

This project was completed under the guidance of **Mo Chen**, enhancing my skills in Excel-based data analysis, visualisation, and business insight generation.

## Business Task

The goal was to help the coffee business make data-driven decisions by analysing:

- Most and least popular coffee types  
- Customer preferences for roast types and sizes  
- Sales trends across months and years  
- Regional sales performance  
- Customer loyalty impact on purchasing behaviour

---

## Skills Applied

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH)  
- Data Cleaning & Preparation (standardising values, handling missing data)  
- Data Sorting & Filtering (analysing by year, month, coffee type)  
- Data Visualisation (bar charts, column charts, trend analysis)  
- Insight Generation (identifying key trends for business decisions)

---

## Process

### 1. Data Preparation
- Ensured consistency in coffee type names (Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, Liberica)  
- Standardised roast types (Light, Medium, Dark)  
- Converted order dates into months and years for trend analysis  
- Verified sales calculations (Quantity × Unit Price)

### 2. Pivot Table Analysis
Created Pivot Tables to analyse:

- Sales by Coffee Type (*Arabica was the highest-selling*)  
- Monthly & Yearly Trends (*peak sales in 2021, seasonal fluctuations*)  
- Regional Performance (*United States dominated sales*)  
- Top Customers (*identified highest-spending customers*)

### 3. Pivot Chart Visualisation
Built interactive charts to highlight:

- Sales by Coffee Type (*Arabica led, followed by Liberica*)  
- Monthly Sales Trends (*highest sales in Q4*)  
- Regional Breakdown (*US accounted for 75% of revenue*)  
- Customer Purchase Behaviour (*loyalty card impact on order frequency*)

- **Arabica** was the top-selling coffee (£10,837.56), followed by **Liberica** (£10,018.75)  
- **Robusta** had the lowest sales (£7,728.80), suggesting potential for promotions or product education

### 2. Regional Sales Trends

- **Ireland** and **UK** had significantly lower sales, indicating potential for market expansion strategies

### 3. Top Customers & Loyalty Impact
- **Allis Wilmore** was the highest-spending customer (£317.07)  
- Loyalty card data could be further analysed to improve retention strategies

### 4. Seasonal Trends
- Sales peaked in **November & December**, likely due to holiday demand

- **Expand US Marketing** – The US is the dominant market; targeted campaigns could further boost sales  
- **Enhance Loyalty Programmes** – Analyse loyalty card data to reward frequent buyers and improve retention  
- **Seasonal Stock Planning** – Prepare for higher demand in Q4 (holiday season)  
- **Explore Growth in Ireland & UK** – Consider localised promotions to increase sales in these regions
