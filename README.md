# ‚òï Coffee Orders Analysis ‚Äì Excel Pivot Charts Project

## About the Project

This project explores customer coffee order trends using Microsoft Excel. The dataset contains detailed order information including drink names, categories, sizes, and order dates. I used **Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to summarize the data, find insights, and visualize key business metrics.

The project was completed under the guidance of **Mo Chen**, and helped enhance my Excel-based data analysis and visualization skills.
